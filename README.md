## SETUP

To use TRANSONIC, first clone the github repository via
```
git clone "https:github.com/matmulmiller/TRANSONIC"
```
For best practices, it is best to create a new python virtual environment to contain the package dependencies.

Next you can install the package dependencies via running the following from within the cloned base directory

```
python setup.py install
```
or

```
python -m pip install .
```

## Running your first case

To test out your setup, we have included an example dataset "example dataset path". To execute the analysis from scratch execute
