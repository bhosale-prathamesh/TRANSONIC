for patient in cohort:
    1.) Generate a patient object 
    2.) Find the optimal model parameters for that patient  
        2.1) Based on which curve? Multi implementation or straight to E-theta?
    3.) Save the optimal model parameters to a list with the same index as DOE doc
    4.) Evaluate goodnes of fit statistics for the model....
        4.1) Some kinda of descriptive parameters (R-squared?) and histogram plot
        4.2) Some way to look at ones which at the tails of the distribution from 4.2
